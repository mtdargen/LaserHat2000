LaserHat 2000 Pro Edition
============

A improvisational exploration into game development

All code, all sounds, all art, created by Matt Dargen

EXCEPT for:
  "Vexations", written by Erik Satie,
    arranged for LaserHat 2000 Pro Edition by Matt Dargen
    
  Bill O Reilly's head, created by Mom and Dad O Reilly,
    crudely cut out in MS Paint by Matt Dargen


This is a game I wrote and am still writing a little bit,
that started as an attempt to answer the question:
"Can I just write a program where I move around a thing?"
That thing was a disgusting plaid fedora.  That fedora is now LaserHat,
defender of a universe, champion of truth,
enemy of crustaceans and Bill O Reilly


#### TO PLAY LASER HAT ####
You will need:

1. Python 3.4
2. Pygame (you'll need the unofficial 3.4 version - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame)

And then, just run main.py,
make sure the directory structure looks just like it does in the repository,
and you should be good 2 go

peace
